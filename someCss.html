        <h1>You died on a Saturday morning, and I had you placed here, under our tree. And I had that house of your father’s bulldozed to the ground. Mama always said dying was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn’t. Little Forrest, he’s doing just fine. ‘Bout to start school again soon. I make his breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. I make sure he combs his hair and brushes his teeth everyday. Teaching him how to play ping-pong. He’s really good. We fish a lot. And everynight we read a book- and he’s so smart Jenny. You’d be so proud of him, I am. He, uh, wrote you a letter, but he says I can’t read it, I’m not supposed to, so I’ll just leave it here for you. Jenny, I don’t know if Mama’s right or if its Lieutenant Dan, I don’t know if we each have a destiny or if we’re all floating around accidental, like on a breeze. But I think maybe its both, maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you, Jenny. If there’s anything you need, I won’t be far away.</h1>
        <p>You used to fit right here. I’d hold you up to say to your mother: This kid’s going to be the best kid in the world. This kid’s going to be somebody better than anybody I ever knew. And you grew up good and wonderful, it was great just watching you everyday, it was like a privilege. To the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world and you did.</p>
